Constraint Programming: Intution to CP
    - Computational paradigm
        - Use constraints to reduce the set of values that each
          variable can take
        - remove values that cannot appear in any solution
       
    - Modeling methodology
        - convey the sturcture of problem as explicitly as
          possible
        - express as sub structures
        - give solvers as much info. as possible

    - 8 Queens problems
        - place 8 queens on a chess board so that none of them
          attach each other
        - two queens attack each other if they are on same column, row or diagonal 
        - In CP, we remove items from search space depending on current solution. For example, in N queens, all the  rows,
          columns and diagonals for each queen are removed
        - Put queen greedily on cloumns row, having only once place left, as we know each column or row will have
          one queen atleast
            
    - Computational paradigm ( revisited )
        - Choice
            - make a choice when no more deduction can be done
            - Assume a choice assigns a value to a variable
            - Choices are often wrong, the solver backtracks and tries another value
        - Specification:
            - Coloring a Map: Two adjacent territories receive the same color
            - Theorem proved with a computer: Every map can be colored with 4 colors
            - choose the decision variables
                - The color given to each country
                - Domain is set of values that a variable can take, i.e. 4 diff. colors
            - Express constraints in terms of decision variable
                - specify that two adjacent countries cannot be given same color
            - High level language model example on Slide 9: Coloring a Map
            - Slide 12: Example on a Map with countries
        - Branch and Prune:
            - Pruning: Reduce the search space as much as possible by using constraints
            - Branching : decompose the problems into subproblems

        - Complete method, not a heuristic:
            - Given enough time, it will find a solution to a satisfaction problem ( N-queens)
            - Given enough time, it will find an optimal solution to an optimzation problem

        - Focus on feasibility:
            - How to use constraints to prune the search space
                                        
        - What does constraint do?
            - Feasibility checking: Node we are exploring is potentially feasible, if a constraint can be satisfied given the domain of variables
            - Helps to prune the search space

        - Propagation engine:
            - This is the core of CP
            - It is an iterative fix-point algorithm ( Read? )
            - Select  a constraint C
            - Algorithm: ( Slide 29)
                - If C is feasible use it prune the space, if not then return faliure
                - Keep iterating over constraints until no constraint can remove any value from the domain of its variables ( Fix point state )
                - After fix point state, the system is asked to make a choice 
        - What are decision variables?
            - many possible modellings
            - Example N-queens
                - associate a decision variable with each column
                - the variable denotes the row of the column on which queen is to be placed

% From this step we just take the important point as doubts a notes, as the slide as quite good %
                - Not clear for upward diagonal? Ok got it, from exp. on Slide 32. Important
                - Isn't this formulation a bit optimistic as we are just interested in one row up or below for the diagonal?

        - Simple example for feasibility checking, X neq Y 
            -( Slide 35 not clear) Why greater than 1 or 2? Shouldn't it be greater than the min. of either sets?
            - Pruning Occurs only if one of the variable can pick only one value. IMP. Slide 36
